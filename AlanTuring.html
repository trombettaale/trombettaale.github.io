		   <p>Alan Mathison Turing was a British mathematician, logician, cryptographer and philosopher, considered one of the fathers of computer science and one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century.His work had vast influence on the birth of the computer science discipline, thanks to its formalization  of the concepts of algorithm and calculation using the machine of the same name, which in turn constituted a significant step forward in the evolution towards the modern computer.  For this contribution he is usually considered the father of computer science and artificial intelligence, which he theorized as early as the 1930s, and also one of the most brilliant cryptanalysts who worked in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, to decipher messages.  traded by diplomats and Axis Power troops, during which he worked at Bletchley Park, the UK's leading cryptoanalysis center, where he devised a number of techniques for breaking German ciphers, including the use of an electromechanical machine (called "  Bomba ") capable of decoding codes created by the Enigma cryptographic machine.He committed suicide at the age of 41, following persecution by the British authorities for his homosexuality.</p>
		   <h2> THE IMITATION GAME</h2>
		   <p>In 1939, at the beginning of World War II, the British government brings together a team of top mathematicians to break the German Enigma code. The most brilliant of the mathematicians is 27 year-old Alan Turing. He has no social skills, however, and soon annoys the rest of the team. He’s a homosexual, at a time when homosexual sex was illegal in Britain. Alan wants to build a machine to break the code, an early version of a digital computer. The rest of the team think he’s wasting time and money, except for Joan Clarke who thinks the same way as Alan. Joan’s parents are unhappy with her situation as a young unmarried woman at Bletchley. Alan rescues the situation by asking her to marry him. At first, Alan’s machine doesn’t work. But a chance remark gives Alan an idea, and his machine finally cracks the code. Although the team celebrate wildly, they can’t tell anyone. If the Germans guess that they have cracked the code, they will simply change it. Alan and his team assess all the German messages they intercept, acting on some information but not all. Sometimes they must allow German attacks to succeed. When Alan discovers that John, a member of the team, is a spy, and M16 threaten to put Joan in prison, Alan decides that Bletchley is not safe for Joan. He tells her he doesn’t love her and she must leave. Joan is very upset, but refuses to leave. The war finally ends. The team has to promise never to discuss their secret war work. Alan moves to Manchester university. In 1952, he is arrested for homosexual activity. He is offered a choice: prison or pills. He chooses the second. The medication is powerful and dangerous; it destroys his mind and his body. Alan commits
              suicide.<br><font color="red">THE BACK STORY</font></br>
			  Winston Churchill said that Alan Turing made the biggest single contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany. By brilliantly decoding Enigma, Turing gave the Allies a big advantage. Without Turing, Hitler might have won. The Imitation Game is a dramatised version of Alan Turing’s story. The real Turing is described as warm and funny, by people who knew him. Another important character in the film is Commander Denniston, who comes across as ignorant and rude. Commander Denniston’s family say he was kind and always polite, and are unhappy with the way he appears. However accurate the film is, it makes a very exciting drama. The Imitation Game won an Oscar in 2015 for the Best Screenplay, with nominations for Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing and Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke, as well as Best Picture.

              The Imitation Game (2014) was directed by Morten Tyldum. It stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing and Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke.
